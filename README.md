# SciDB
To get SciDB, visit http://Paradigm4.com.
The purpose of this repository is to enable people register and track issues with SciDB.
See https://github.com/Paradigm4/SciDB/issues.
For each issue, we will create a private companion ticket in Paradigm4's private bug-tracking system.
If you have data useful to reproduce an encountered issue but you do not want it seen by the public, let us know. We will arrange to have you send your data to us privately, and the data will be stored in the private companion ticket.
